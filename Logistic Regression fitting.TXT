# Fitting the Logistic Regression to the data set -----------------------
# glm - generalised linear model

classifier <- glm(formula = Class ~ .,
                  family = binomial,
                  data = training)
classifier
summary(classifier)

# Predicting the Test set results -----------------------------------------

prob_pred <- predict(classifier, type = 'response', newdata = test[-11])
prob_pred

# create a vector of our predicted results
# we consider the limit 50% any values under 0.5 will be equalised to 0 (not bought) and
# any values above 0.5 will be considered 1(bought)

y_pred <- ifelse(prob_pred > 0.5, 1, 0)
y_pred

## Another simple example: all features nees to be numeric, 
## eliminate factor or character features before runing this :

model <- glm(LastYear ~ Year1 + Year2 + Year3 + Year4 + Year5,
